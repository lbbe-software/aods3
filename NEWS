      CHANGES IN aods3 VERSION 0.4-1 (released on 16 June 2013)
      =========================================================

DOCUMENTATION

    o Several help pages were sanitized for a better layout of their
      pdf version.

    o The help page for aodml was changed to reflect changes in the code

      - component trace set to 0 in the list provided to "control".

      - argument digits added to the print method for anova.aodml.

CODE

    o In aodml, in the list provided to control, "trace"" was set to 0
      to avoid spurious warnings.

    o In print.summary.aodml, display of fixed-effect model coefficients,
      and associated se, z, and p values was changed for better reading
      (scientific notation for absolute values < 10^-4).

    o In print.summary.aodml, display of phi coefficients and associated se
      was changed for better reading (scientific notation for absolute
      values < 10^-4).

    o A "digits" argument was added to the print method for anova.aodml.
