Description: Provides functions to analyse overdispersed
        counts or proportions.  These functions should be considered as
        complements to more sophisticated methods such as generalized
        estimating equations (GEE) or generalized linear mixed effect
        models (GLMM). aods3 is an S3 re-implementation of the
        deprecated S4 package aod.
